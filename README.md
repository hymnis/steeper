# Steeper

Based on *teatime-unity* by Pavel Rojtberg.

## Name
The name comes partly from the fact that it's a tool for measuring steeping time of tea, but also that the duration curve gets steeper for every brew (using increment and brew counter).

## Features
- Brew counter
- Brew duration increment (based on counter)
- Optional brew counting

## Todo
- libcanbarra support (for audio notification)
- Settings (custom notification sound etc.)
- Better menu (setting, help, about, quit)
- Wider "Brews" column (get's chopped on some systems)
- Manual brew count adjustment (dec/inc)
